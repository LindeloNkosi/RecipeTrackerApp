# Recipe Tracker Application

This Java program allows users to input and track recipe details including ingredients, time to make, and difficulty level. The program uses object-oriented principles and a simple command-line interface.

## Description

This project is designed to record and display recipe details using a simple Java application. Users can input the ingredients, time required to make the recipe, and the difficulty level. The application then displays the entered details.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter recipe details such as ingredients, time, and difficulty level.
- **Data Display**: Displays the entered recipe details in a formatted manner.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes inheritance and interfaces to manage recipe data.

## Skills and Lessons Learned

- **Java Programming**: Practiced creating and managing classes, constructors, and methods.
- **Inheritance and Interfaces**: Implemented inheritance and interfaces to structure the program.
- **Scanner Class**: Used the Scanner class for user input.
- **Data Encapsulation**: Learned to encapsulate data using private fields and public getters.
- **Polymorphism**: Utilized polymorphism to handle different types of recipes.

## Program Notes

- **BankingApplication Class**: The main class that runs the program and handles user input.
- **ProcessRecipe Class**: A subclass that extends Recipes and processes the entered recipe details.
- **Recipes Class**: An abstract class that defines the structure of a recipe.
- **iRecipes Interface**: An interface that declares the method to print recipe details.
